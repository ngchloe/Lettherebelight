# Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion using Textual Inversion
Training my own Textual Inversion model for Stable Diffusion and ControlNet for Architectural Renderings

Date: May 2023

Programs/tools concerned:
•	Stable Diffusion 1.5 – Automatic1111
•	ControlNet
•	Textual Inversion
Stable Diffusion and ControlNet are powerful tools with good potential to accelerate the workflow from a basic preliminary Sketchup model view to a visual rendering (albeit draft) of the model in the quickest time possible, with various iterations possible. While this already allows for visual renderings to be generated, the objective of this experiment is to further finetune and enhance the visual rendering through the training and use of a Textual Inversion model.
Thus, this document outlines my attempts at training my own Textual Inversion model in Stable Diffusion (SD) 1.5.
